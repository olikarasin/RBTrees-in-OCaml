# **Implementing Red-Black Trees in OCaml**

## **Introduction**

A Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where each node contains an additional bit of information: a color (red or black). This additional property ensures that the tree remains balanced, providing an efficient O(logâ€¯n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations.

In this implementation, you will use functional programming principles to implement a Red-Black Tree in OCaml. The project focuses on three key components: **insertion**, **deletion**, and **tree validity checking**. Each of these components ensures that the Red-Black Tree adheres to its five defining properties.

## **Red-Black Tree Properties**

1. **Every node is either red or black.**
2. **The root node is black.**
3. **All leaves (`Nil`) are black.**
4. **Red nodes cannot have red children.**
5. **Every path from a node to its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes.** (This is referred to as the black-height.)

Violations of these properties during insertion or deletion must be resolved to maintain the tree's balance and validity.

## **Data Type Definitions**

1. **Color Type**: Represents the color of a node.
   ```ocaml
   type color = Red | Black
   ```

2. **Tree Type**: Recursive data structure representing the tree.
   ```ocaml
   type 'a rb_tree =
     | Nil
     | Node of color * 'a * 'a rb_tree * 'a rb_tree
   ```

The `Nil` nodes represent black leaves, while the `Node` stores a value, a color, and references to left and right subtrees.

## **1. Insertion**

Insertion involves adding a new node while preserving the tree's properties. After a standard BST insertion, you must **rebalance** the tree using the `balance` function. 

### **Helper Function: `balance`**
The `balance` function handles the four rebalancing cases that occur when a red node has a red parent. The key steps include rotations and recoloring to restore the tree's properties.

```ocaml
let balance (color : color) (value : 'a) (left : 'a rb_tree) (right : 'a rb_tree) : 'a rb_tree = 
  match color, value, left, right with
  | (* TODO: Add pattern matching for the four cases *)
  | _, _, _, _ -> Node (color, value, left, right)
```

### **Insertion Function**
You will implement both non-tail-recursive (`insert`) and tail-recursive (`insert_tr`) versions of the insertion function. 

```ocaml
let insert (tree: 'a rb_tree) (value: 'a): 'a rb_tree =
  let rec insert_aux = function
    | Nil -> (* TODO: Add base case for inserting a new node *)
    | Node (_,_,_,_) -> (* TODO: Add recursive case for BST insertion with balancing *)
  in
  (* TODO: Ensure the root remains black after insertion *)
```

**Key Insight**: The functional implementation of insertion differs from imperative implementations. Okasaki's algorithm emphasizes immutability and elegant recursion, often resulting in structurally distinct but valid trees.

## **2. Deletion**

Deletion involves removing a node while maintaining Red-Black properties. If the removed node is black, special handling is required to restore the black-height, often creating a **double-black** situation.

### **Helper Functions**
- **`recolor`**: Ensures that the replacement node remains black.
- **`min_value_node`**: Finds the smallest value in the right subtree when replacing a node with two children.
- **`balance_delete`**: Resolves violations caused by double-black nodes through rotations and recoloring.

```ocaml
let balance_delete (node : 'a rb_tree) : 'a rb_tree =
  match node with
  | (* TODO: Handle rebalancing cases during deletion *)
  | _ -> node
```

### **Deletion Function**
```ocaml
let delete (tree : 'a rb_tree) (value: 'a): 'a rb_tree =
  let rec del node =
    match node with
    | Nil -> (* TODO: Handle the case where the value is not found *)
    | Node (_,_,_,_) -> (* TODO: Implement recursive deletion and rebalancing *)
  in
  (* TODO: Ensure the root remains black after deletion *)
```

---

## **3. Tree Validity**

Validation ensures that the tree adheres to the five Red-Black properties. Use the following helper functions:

1. **`black_height`**: Computes the black-height of each path and checks for consistency.
2. **`no_red_with_red_child`**: Ensures no red node has a red child.

```ocaml
let is_valid (tree : 'a rb_tree) : bool =
  let rec black_height = function
    | Nil -> (* TODO: Implement base case for leaves *)
    | Node (_,_,_,_) -> (* TODO: Compute and validate black-height *)
  in
  let rec no_red_with_red_child = function
    | Nil -> true
    | Node (Red,_,Node (Red,_,_,_),_)
    | Node (Red,_,_,Node (Red,_,_,_)) -> false
    | Node (_,_,_,_) -> (* TODO: Traverse and validate child nodes *)
  in
  (* TODO: Combine black-height and red-violation checks *)
```

## **Conclusion**

This problem challenges you to implement Red-Black Tree operations using functional programming principles. Focus on recursive logic, immutability, and balancing strategies. Use helper functions like `balance` and `balance_delete` to encapsulate complex rebalancing logic. By adhering to the Red-Black properties, your implementation will maintain tree balance and efficiency.

Good luck, and remember to test thoroughly at each step!
